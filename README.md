# Billy - Smart Practice Management

**A streamlined, web-based tool for patient management and automated invoicing tailored for physiotherapists and osteopaths.**

---

## 🎯 The Problem (Business Case)
Independent therapists often lose up to 4 hours per week on manual invoicing using disconnected tools like Word or Excel. This operational inefficiency leads to calculation errors, missed payments (revenue leakage), and significantly less time dedicated to patient care.

## 💡 The Solution
**Billy** is a Django-based web application designed to digitize and automate the billing workflow. It bridges the gap between patient data and financial records.

**Key Features:**
* **Service Catalog:** Centralized management of treatments and prices to ensure consistency.
* **One-Click Invoicing:** Automated generation of professional PDF invoices based on treatment data.
* **Financial Dashboard:** Real-time overview of monthly revenue and overdue invoices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python 3.11, Django 5.0
* **Database:** SQLite (Dev), PostgreSQL (Production-ready)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 (Responsive Design)
* **PDF Engine:** WeasyPrint / ReportLab

## 🚀 Key User Stories (MVP)
This product was built based on the following prioritized requirements:
1.  *As a therapist, I want to select services from a pre-defined catalog so that I avoid pricing errors during manual entry.*
2.  *As a therapist, I want to instantly see which invoices are overdue so that I can prioritize payment follow-ups.*
3.  *As a therapist, I want to export invoices as PDFs to email them directly to patients.*
